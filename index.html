    <h1> Welcome to our store!</h1>
    <p>As you can see there are no products here, that's because our web developer is silly and said we needed at least two pages on this site. He had certain needs he needed filled that had to do with the number of web pages.</p>

    <h2>His Solution:</h2>
    <p>So what we had to do was make a "homepage" welcoming you here and explaining our situtaion and then a "storepage" with all of our top quality and only shirts you ever need in your life, ever.</p>
    <p>That page can be found <a href="storepage.html">here!</a> OH! Yeah we should also tell you we work exclusively for ICBM. (That's why we're stationed in the same building, makes shipping a lot easier to manage!)</p>
